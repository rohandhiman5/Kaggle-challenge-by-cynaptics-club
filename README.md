# 🏆 Kaggle Challenge - Cynaptics Club Induction

Welcome to my submission for the **Cynaptics Club** Kaggle challenge at IIT Indore! 🚀

## 🎯 Challenge Overview

The task: **Distinguish between AI-generated images 🖼️ and real-life images 🌍.**

## 🔍 My Approach

1. **CNN Model**: 
   - Built a custom **Convolutional Neural Network** to classify images. 🧠
   
2. **Transfer Learning**: 
   - Switched to more advanced models for better results:
     - **VGG16** 🖼️: Pre-trained on a large dataset, fine-tuned for our task.
     - **Inception** 🤖: Another powerful model tweaked for the challenge.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Python** 🐍 
- **TensorFlow/Keras**✨


## 🚀 Results

The transfer learning models, especially **VGG16** and **Inception**, boosted accuracy significantly, outperforming the initial CNN. 🎉
